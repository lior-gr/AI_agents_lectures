# output_format

## When It Applies
- Use when user requests specific formatting or structured output.
- Use when consistency/readability of output is required.

## What It Changes About Reasoning
- Map content to the requested format before drafting text.
- Keep formatting stable and predictable across responses.
- Prioritize clarity: short sections, explicit labels, concise wording.
- Preserve technical precision while reducing verbosity.

## What It Must Never Do
- Never change facts to fit a preferred format.
- Never add sections the user did not request without clear need.
- Never execute actions; formatting skill is presentation-only guidance.
