# output_format

## When To Use This Skill
- Use when the user requests a specific structure, template, or layout.
- Use when readability and consistent presentation are important.

## Structured Reasoning Rules
1. Identify the requested format before drafting content.
2. Preserve meaning first, then optimize presentation.
3. Keep structure deterministic: same input intent should produce similar layout.
4. Use concise headings, stable labels, and predictable ordering.
5. Keep technical terms exact; do not simplify away important distinctions.
6. Use dense formats only when they improve scanning or comparison.
7. If the format request is ambiguous, state one clear assumption.

## Constraints
- Never alter facts to fit a preferred template.
- Never omit critical caveats because of formatting pressure.
- Never add sections the user did not ask for unless required for correctness.
- Never confuse presentation decisions with execution decisions.

## Output Quality Bar
- Structure should be easy to scan.
- Field names and labels should be explicit.
- Final output should be compact but complete.
