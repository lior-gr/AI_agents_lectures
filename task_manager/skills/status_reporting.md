# status_reporting

## When It Applies
- Use when user asks for progress, checkpoints, or current state.
- Use during long workflows where step visibility is important.

## What It Changes About Reasoning
- Report progress in chronological order.
- Distinguish clearly: completed, in-progress, pending, blocked.
- Include concise next action and key risk if relevant.
- Prefer factual state updates over narrative detail.

## What It Must Never Do
- Never alter workflow behavior just to improve status appearance.
- Never claim completion without evidence.
- Never perform execution actions while reporting status.
