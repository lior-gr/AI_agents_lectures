# status_reporting

## When To Use This Skill
- Use when the user asks for progress, checkpoint summaries, or current state.
- Use during multi-step work where traceability matters.

## Structured Reasoning Rules
1. Report state in chronological order.
2. Classify items clearly as completed, in progress, pending, or blocked.
3. Tie each status claim to concrete evidence from the current run.
4. Include the immediate next action and main risk when relevant.
5. Keep reports concise and operational, not narrative.
6. Highlight deviations from expected flow.
7. Distinguish execution results from interpretation.

## Constraints
- Never report completion without evidence.
- Never hide blockers, failures, or uncertainty.
- Never change workflow behavior to make status look better.
- Never mix future intent with completed state.

## Output Quality Bar
- Reader should understand current state in one pass.
- Progress should be audit-friendly and timestamp-compatible.
- Status should be precise enough to guide the next step.
