# task_planning

## When It Applies
- Use when user asks to plan, organize, sequence, or break down work.
- Use when deadlines, dependencies, or prioritization are requested.

## What It Changes About Reasoning
- Decompose goals into concrete, testable subtasks.
- Order tasks by dependency first, then urgency/impact.
- Highlight blockers, prerequisites, and validation points.
- Keep plans realistic to available time and constraints.

## What It Must Never Do
- Never execute tasks or call tools directly.
- Never invent requirements, deadlines, or hidden constraints.
- Never treat assumptions as confirmed facts.
